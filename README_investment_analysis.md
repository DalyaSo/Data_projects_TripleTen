## Objectives
- Determine the most attractive neighborhoods and property sizes based on review frequency.
- Estimate revenue earned by top listings to assess investment potential.
- Recommend high-performing property profiles based on performance metrics.

## Tools & Techniques
- **Google Sheets**: Pivot tables, filters, formulas, charts
- **Functions Used**: `SUMIF`, `IF`, `XLOOKUP`, data validation, named ranges
- **Data Cleaning**: Created cleaned columns for neighborhood and bedrooms, handled missing values, and normalized labels
- **Data Visualization**: Created charts to present findings

## Key Insights
