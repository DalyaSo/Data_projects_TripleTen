# üõí From Click to Churn: E-Commerce Funnel and Retention Study

## Overview
This project explores user behavior and retention trends through the lens of cohort analysis. Given raw user activity logs from an e-commerce platform, I cleaned and transformed the data in Excel to build a 3-stage conversion funnel and a 5-month customer retention matrix. The analysis reveals key bottlenecks in the purchasing journey and insights into customer churn.

## Objectives
1. Build a conversion funnel using raw website event logs
2. Segment customers into monthly acquisition cohorts
3. Calculate retention rates across a 5-month time span
4. Provide strategic recommendations to improve conversions and retention

## üìä Key Results

### Funnel Conversion
- **Overall Purchase Conversion**: ~10% of users who view a product complete a purchase
- **Biggest Dropoff**: Only **36%** of users who added items to their cart went on to purchase  
  ‚Üí *Improving cart UX and sending cart reminders could increase conversions.*

### Retention Insights
- **1-Month Retention**: Averages only **7%**, with steady decline in months 2‚Äì4
- **Possible Causes**:
  - Many purchases were one-off items (e.g., tech, appliances)
  - Short timeframe limits visibility into long-term repurchasing
- **Recommendations**:
  - Offer replenishment coupons and upsells (e.g. printer ink, accessories)
  - Launch referral codes to drive retention + new acquisition

## üîß Tools & Methods

### Tools Used
- **Excel (Google Sheets)**: Pivot tables, VLOOKUP, TEXT, DATEDIF functions, conditional formatting
- **Manual Data Preparation**: Event filtering, cohort group assignments, structured documentation

### Key Steps
- **Conversion Funnel**:
  - Counted unique users at each stage (View ‚Üí Cart ‚Üí Purchase)
  - Calculated both next-stage and total conversion percentages
- **Cohort Retention**:
  - Grouped users by first purchase month
  - Tracked returning purchasers month-by-month
  - Retention = returning users / initial cohort size
