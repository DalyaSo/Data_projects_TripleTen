# üßπ Data Preparation ‚Äì Return Cause Analysis

This document outlines the data cleaning, transformation, and merging steps used to prepare the dataset for Tableau analysis.

---

## üìÅ Source Files

- `Orders` sheet ‚Äî Contains order-level sales and shipping data
- `Returns` sheet ‚Äî Contains a list of `Order ID`s that were returned
- Both sheets were extracted from the original `Superstore.xls` file

## üîó Join Strategy

### Objective:
To identify which orders were returned and calculate return-related metrics by product, customer, region, and time.

### Join Method:
- **Left Join**: `Orders` LEFT JOIN `Returns`  
  - Key field: `Order ID`
  - Purpose: Preserve all order records, even those not returned

---

## üîß Steps Taken (in Excel):

1. **Add a "Returned" Column** to the Orders sheet  
   - Used `XLOOKUP` to match `Order ID` from the Returns sheet  
   - Formula used:
     ```excel
     =XLOOKUP(A2, Returns!B:B, Returns!A:A, "No")
     ```
   - Replaced blank matches with `"No"` to indicate the order was not returned

2. **Create a Binary "Return Flag" Column**  
   - Formula:
     ```excel
     =IF(B2="Yes", 1, 0)
     ```
   - Used for numerical calculations in Tableau (e.g., return rate, total returns)

3. **Remove Irrelevant Columns**  
   - Dropped `Row ID` (Column A), which served no analytical purpose

4. **Final Save**  
   - Saved the cleaned and merged file as `Return_Cause_Analysis_Data.csv`
